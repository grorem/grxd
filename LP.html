						<h3>AN ACCESSIBLE & MOBILE/WEB-ALIGNED STUDENT ACTIVITY EXPERIENCE.</h3>



					</div>

			<div class="col-sm-6 imgMargins">
				<p>
					Our current courseware of lessons and activities was stuck in the past, literally, old deprecated systems unable to deliever new content without a mountain of fuss for our
					academics, nor could it track usage data to better inform myself and product owners of where opportunities may exist.
				</p>

				<p>
					The mobile experience wasn't linked to the web experience, two separate back ends, sometimes different front ends.. (i.e. templates weren't the same in lessons) and this was particularly cited in support calls
					as a pain point for students.
				</p>

				<p>
					Accessibility was lacking, and was very important to not only users but recent BU inroads with B2G (Business to government) accounts. So I used this as the driving metric for the designs, as this needed to improve not just from the standpoint of business needs, but that I'm a firm believer in accessible design for all, dare I say particularly in the education space.

							<h3>CURRENT TEMPLATES</h3>

							<p>
								in doing so our first step was to refresh the design of the legacy self study content and activities, interactions and experience of what we have today, as well as set up first steps towards a vision of the product towards the future.
							</p>

							<p>
								Identifying opportunities for updating templates in the new system
							</p>

							<p>
								This future vision being a far more connected experience, where the tools interact with other core features and moments of the student journey.

								<h3>COLABORATE, IDEATE, ITERATE..<span class="faded"> REMOTELY.</span></h3>

								<p>
									It was March 2020..
								</p>

								<p>
									We all became familiar with Miro & Figjam, closely collaborating over video, and fueled a wider org transition to fully adopting Figma.
									We started to discuss current learning templates, their flows, and how both the UX and the UI would change for each with the first goal of
									importing current legacy content into this new system.
								</p>

								<p>
									Not just helping students to see how tiny things over a long period moves the needle, but ourselves as well to be able to track design metrics..

									<h3>FLEXIBILITY, SCALABILITY & A DESIGN SYSTEM.</h3>

									<p>
										With the dev team working in Angular, and an existing global design system, which places emphasis on core [base rules and components] and expression
										[where we change certain attributes to align with a product's particular needs].
									</p>

									<p>
										I not only wanted to bring legacy design into this new modern system, but set up the "expression" that our product would take in relation
										to our other experiences and apps across the wider EF.STUDIO product.

										Catalyst templates 2.0 - freakin' mobile even

										More importantly, connecting data and usage so we can track and inform students of their study and ourselves of opportunities.

										Not just authoring the templates themselves anymore, but key moments of the experience which touch onboarding [assessment link] and classroom.

										quick [very] high-level usability testing I could fit in.
