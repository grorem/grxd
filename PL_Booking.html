			<div class="col-sm-6 imgMargins">
				<p>
					We had an old private lesson booking system with and a new, refactored system coming online.
					<b>The business asked us</b> to increase private lesson booking rates.
					As quantitative data showed Private Lesson bookings as significantly lower than that of Group lessons.
					A metric closely tied to student satisfaction scores.
				</p>

				<p>
					We put a banner in the online school which students followed to both a survey and an asynchronous,
					unmoderated click-through prototype session using maze.design.
				</p>

				<p>
					The feedback we collected suggested something causing a high abandon rate within the Private Lesson booking journey.
				</p>

				<p>
					Insights from the survey and unmoderated sessions revealed a few common threads:
				</p>

				<p>
					“I don’t know what to do”<br>
					“I don’t have time for this”<br>
					“I can’t find a teacher”<br>
					“I have to do this all again?”<br>

							<h3>A NEW BOOKING FLOW.</h3>

							<p>
								Using insights from the user surveys and unmoderated testing, as well as alignment meetings with stakeholders, we came up with a set of user goals for us to guide us:
							</p>

							<p>
								1. Reduce friction & remove repetition.
							</p>

							<p>
								2. Separate new & recurring booking flows
							</p>

							<p>
								3. Always accessible & available.
							</p>

							<p>
								From this, I put together the wireframes and flows you see on the right.

								<h3>PROTOTYPE EARLY, ITERATE QUICKLY.</h3>

								<p>
									Leveraging our recently made and still forming brand design system & guidelines, I put together prototypes for mobile and web, so we could get a better feel for our designs,
									and I wanted to put a phone right in stakeholders’ hands at the next review when we aimed to additionally gain buy-in for moderated studies using the prototypes to better inform final design efforts.

									<h3>TESTING.</h3>

									<p>
										<b>Selection criteria</b><br>
										Five existing students from the France and Spain markets currently studying in the first 3 of 16 levels of EF English Live, with 2 Free private lessons given as incentive.
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Materials</b><br>
										A session guide (script) & a high-fidelity prototype of the mobile experience.
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Method</b><br>
										Remote task-based moderated session with a facilitator fluent in the local language and an observer/note-taker.
									</p>

									<p>
										Tasks included: Booking a lesson, rebooking a previous teacher for next Friday, finding a teacher with a specific knowledge background, filtering by teachers fluent in your language, requesting a topic not available in the list shown.
									</p>

										<h3>AN INCREASE IN RELEVANT BOOKINGS</h3>



									</div>

							</div>


							<div class="col-sm-6 imgMargins">
								<p>
									What did I change from the feedback gathered in user studies?
								</p>

								<p>
									Pre-select class next-most not yet done lesson topic rather than highlighting with a star, as it wasn’t clear what the star meant.
								</p>

								<p>
									Make teacher profiles/preferences more immediately relevant to classes and actionable: e.g. add toggle ‘show teachers who speak my language’ instead of the need to browse teachers by language.
								</p>

								<p>
									Instead of just showing a previously selected teacher as unavailable, after time selection, add toggle to show previous teacher availability. Let the student decide if they want to prioritize booking time or the teacher.
								</p>

								<p>
									We could immediately see the difference, with the new system at first rolled out to a smaller set of students, the abandon rate had taken a nose dive as could be continuously compared to students still on the old system.
								</p>

								<p>
									This update has since been rolled out to virtually all students by merit of their products having been migrated to the new system.
