					<h3><span class="faded">THE PROBLEM SPACE.</span> <br>LESSONS, AUTHORING, DATA, TEACHERS.</h3>

					<p>
						A core feature of an EF student’s learning journey is self-study:
						Learning activities in context of a course cirriculum alongside group and private classes with teachers.
					</p>

					<p>
						More than simply align the experience between mobile and web [they weren't at all aligned], We set out to update the underlying technology that serves this content and learning to students, to update the experience to be less an arbitrary march
						of ticking boxes (lessons, classes, activities), and more an informative, engaging and personalized learning journey.
					</p>

					<p>
						in doing so our first step was to refresh the design of the legacy self study content and activities, interactions and experience of what we have today, as well as set up first steps towards a vision of the product towards the future.
						<br>This future vision being a far more connected experience, where the tools interact with other core features and moments of the student journey.

						<h3><span class="faded">COLABORATE, IDEATE, ITERATE..</span> REMOTELY.</h3>

						<p>
							Almost goes without saying with this being the first big project to start during the 'rona.
						</p>

						<p>
							We all became familiar with Miro & Figjam, closely collaborating over video, and fueled a wider org transition to fully adopting Figma.
							We started to discuss current learning templates, their flows, and how both the UX and the UI would change for each with the first goal of
							importing current legacy content into this new system.

							<h3>FLEXIBILITY, SCALABILITY & A DESIGN SYSTEM.</h3>

							<p>
								With the dev team working in Angular, and an existing global design system, which places emphasis on core [base rules and components] and expression
								[where we change certain attributes to align with a product's particular needs].
							</p>

							<p>
								We not only wanted to bring legacy design into this new modern system, but set up the "expression" that our product would take in relation
								to our other experiences and apps across the wider EF.STUDIO product.

									Example annotated wireframes for the structure by which we'd import current legacy learning templates.

									Working with product and engineering, we prioritized the order in which I would create these plans template by template without
									review syncs and iteration before getting into final UI.

								<h3>ITERATIONS AND TESTING.</h3>

								<p>
									I started to kick up the fidelity after my first discussions and rounds of feedback with engineering and product.

								<p>
									I would put together a responsive set of screens and a prototype for each template to express the look and feel, flow, and animation timings; as well as any
									quick [very] high-level usability testing I could fit in.
