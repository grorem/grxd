					<h4>"Ask for foregiveness, not permission."</h4>

					<p>
						The primary goal given to us from the business, was to provide clients (businesses who purchased EF learning for their employees) a way to monitory activity and progress.
					</p>

					<p>
						This, along with a UI overhaul and giving quick actions to users, was quickly well-recieved; however, we soon realized a disconnect between the data we were showing on dashboards and charts with the common every-day actions our clients were wanting to take.
					</p>

					<p>
						A so-far missed opportunity for impact.

					<h4>Action with supporting data.</h4>

					<p>
						We decided to test the 'impressive data first to inform actions' approach to the product.
					</p>

					<p>
						We were told by a stakeholder that there was no need to connect with end users on this, something with which I'll always politely disagree.
					</p>

					<p>
						So we did moderated user studies anyway. Working with the product owner, we put together the goals for the study, and came up with a mix of interview and observational tasks.

							<h4>Time for updates and a new approach.</h4>

							<p>
								While we found that the new product fulfills many of the needs of clients quite well, it became clear that the features were guided by not the end user, but
								business stakeholders.
							</p>

							<p>
								The data-first to inform actions approach was the wrong way around, and we decided to pursue further investigation to find provide.
							</p>

							<p>
								Additionally, the UI was designed with an upper breakpoint of 1920, which looks great on an Apple cinema display, but isn't true-to-life for the end user, who almost all use those Lenovos with the red nipple mouse in the center of the keyboard.
								So kicking it down to 1440, and accomodating the UI to not be cluttered well down to 769px (just before the 768 tablet breakpoint) it was then.
