				<h4>"Handing chewie a (non-alcoholic) beer."</h4>

				<p>
					Aligning business goals to our intuition for an inherently better
					user experience is easier said than done, yet facilitating this communication
					is one of the primary roles of a designer.
				</p>

				<p>We knew what things about our product we felt are obvious to-dos, but we aren't the only ones who should be involved.
					While simultaneously conducting studies with students and clients, I led a series of initial workshops with our business
					and operations teams to go through the current product and highlight known issues.
				</p>

				<p>
					My goal was to drive the conversation to be about the product as a whole end-to-end experience, rather than
					a collection of pages and screens.

						<h4>App recordings.</h4>

						<p>
							Having identified affinity of issues across the views for the overall product, as similar issues and thoughts spanned the divisions of discrete UIs, I led a follow-up workshop to explore possible ideas to pursue and come to a consensus of the priority.
						</p>

						<p>This priority, and information we collected from data and recent user studies, then led to a round of initial conceptual wireframes for further exploring possible directions.</p>

						<h4>Helping out in urgent times.</h4>

						<p>
							Sometimes, I've gone to extra lengths wearing hats outside my immediate work specification. One such time was when we had 3 months
							to go to delivery on a large project while at Agency, and one PM had let things slip for 2 of those months, had a breakdown, and left for another job. leaving the company in a lurch.
						</p>

						<p>
							I put on the PM hat and a solid month of 90hour weeks ensued managing a team to get all the content in place and scrape databases with PHP to migrate current content to the new platform.
