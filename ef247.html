					<h3>PROBLEM SPACE</h3>

					<p>
						<b>Business Needs:</b><br>Acquisition of new students is expensive, often a near 1:1 cost via advertisements.

						<b>User pain points:</b><br>Constant calls from telesales, resulting in low app store reviews citing specifically this issue and high attrition rate.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Challenge to explore:</b><br>How might we reduce the high cost of leads acquisition and increase ROI while reducing user friction by providing a means to experience and trial the product on their own.

						<b>Data driven</b><br>Needed to prove with data and ultimately results [ROI], not just our intuitions for what we felt was the right direction.

						<h3>APPROACH & HYPOTHESIS.</h3>

						<p>
							The below initial explorations of the app IA and leads funnels show our proposal to the business for an experiential way to collect leads information,
						</p>

						<p>
							We set out to create something that can be actively tested, and adaptive. Data was the name of the game, and in particular, what observations we see in the
							download -> lead -> show, show -> close.
						</p>

						<p>
							We wanted to develop and test the idea that providing potential new students with an experience-based taste of EF and what we have to
							offer students for their learning goals, would be more effective than traditional advertising by providing students an experience they
							can try themselves, and not be immediately contacted by our telesales teams before they could even form an opinion or understand what they want.
						</p>

						<p>
							We set up silmultaneous approaches for info collection. An A flow and a B flow.
							A-flow collecting all information up front and getting all features up front,
							and B-flow allowing for trying out the experience a bit and giving lead info for accessing new features.

						<h3>We knew the what fairly well, but what about the why?</h3>

						<p>
							This is the interplay between quantitative data and qualitative observation.

							<h3>Restructure & restrategy.</h3>

							<p>
								"Do give them too much, it's a free app." - This didn't mean giving away features of the product, but from in-person moderated studies
								we found that we simply weren't describing enough of how EF works and giving a preview of what students would get once signed up.
							</p>

							<p>
								So we restructured the app to provide this content. Just writing out our teaching methodology, and connecting in-app learning with the equivilent of what would happen once at EF.
							</p>

							<p>
								We approximated our structure, content, and learning activities to their "at-EF" equivilents, and at key milestones of learning, we highlighted this link between in-app content and activities with goings on at EF centers.
