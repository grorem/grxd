				<p>
					Myself paired with another designer each leaning on our
					primary strengths [UX & UI] , VP of marketing technology, a
					team of 6 devs and QA, head of global marketing for the EF
					English Centers business unit.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Business Needs:</b><br>Acquisition of new students is expensive, often a near 1:1 cost with traditional advertisements.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Business Constraints:</b><br>Could not simply replace the current [telesales] method. This needed to live in tandem.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>User pain points:</b><br>Constant calls from telesales, resulting in low app store reviews citing specifically this issue and high attrition rate.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Data driven:</b><br>Needed to prove with data and ultimately results [ROI], not just our intuitions for what we felt was the right direction.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Challenge to explore:</b><br>How might we reduce the high cost of leads acquisition and increase ROI by reducing user friction by providing a means to experience and trial the product on their own.

							<h3>A LIVING HYPOTHESIS</h3>

							<p>
								Pictured right are initial explorations of the app IA and leads funnels showing my proposal to the business for an experiential way to collect leads information.
							</p>

							<p>
								I set out to create something that can be actively tested, and adaptive, as data was the name of the game to react quickly to insights observed in a potential student's journey from <br>
								<b>download -> lead -> show, show -> close.</b>
							</p>

							<!--<p>
								I wanted to design and test the idea that providing potential new students with an experience-based taste of EF, and what we have to
								offer students for their learning goals, would be more effective than traditional advertising by providing students an experience they
								can try themselves, while not being immediately contacted by our telesales teams before they could even form an opinion or understand what they want.
							</p>-->

							<p>
								I proposed silmultaneous approaches for info collection. An A-flow and a B-flow for application onboarding.
								The A-flow collects all information up front and getting all features up front,
								and the B-flow allows for trying out the experience a bit and giving lead info for accessing new features.

									<h3>WE NOW KNEW THE WHAT, SO HOW ABOUT THE WHY?</h3>

									<p>
										This is the interplay between quantitative data and qualitative observation.
									</p>

									<p>
										We had heaps of data, and we could easily see what minor tweaks to the onbarding flow,
										changes to content or activity templates, resulted and what effect down the chain.
									</p>

									<p>
										But at this point, I decided to do a moderated study to uncover what might yet be lacking or missing the mark.

									<h3>RESTRUCTURE WITH A NEW STRATEGY.</h3>

									<p>
										"Do give them too much, it's a free app." - This didn't mean giving away features of the product, but from in-person moderated studies
										we found that we simply weren't describing enough of how EF works and giving a preview of what students would get once signed up.
									</p>

									<p>
										So we restructured the app to provide this content. Just writing out our teaching methodology, and connecting in-app learning with the equivilent of what would happen once at EF.
									</p>

									<p>
										We approximated our structure, content, and learning activities to their "at-EF" equivilents, and at key milestones of learning, we highlighted this link between in-app content and activities with goings on at EF centers.

										<h3>B-FLOW EMERGES TRIUMPHANT.</h3>

							<div class="col-sm-6 imgMargins">
								<p>
									Prospective students no longer harassed by telesales, but rather given time to explore and understand first, were much more willing
								</p>

								<p>
									In sales and numbers terms. The ROI using this application, and particularly prioritizing the B-Flow onboarding experience, increased greatly when compared
									to traditional channels and telesales.
								</p>

								<p>
									The creative space I carved out away from the core student experience regarding activity templates and learning features provided a data-rich sandbox for taking
									these ideas into the core experience in the future.
