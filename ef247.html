					<h3>PROBLEM SPACE</h3>

					<p>
						Myself paired with another designer each leaning on our
primary strengths [UX & UI] , VP of marketing technology, a
team of 6 devs and QA, head of global marketing for the EF
English Centers business unit.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Business Needs:</b><br>Acquisition of new students is expensive, often a near 1:1 cost via advertisements.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>User pain points:</b><br>Constant calls from telesales, resulting in low app store reviews citing specifically this issue and high attrition rate.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Challenge to explore:</b><br>How might we reduce the high cost of leads acquisition and increase ROI while reducing user friction by providing a means to experience and trial the product on their own.
					</p>

					<h3>CONSTRAINTS</h3>


					<p>
						<b>From the business:</b><br>Could not simply replace the current [telesales] method. This needed to live in tandem.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Data driven</b><br>Needed to prove with data and ultimately results [ROI], not just our intuitions for what we felt was the right direction.

					<h3>Funnels.</h3>

					<p>
						With an experiential way to collect leads information,
					</p>

					<p>
						We set out to create something that can be actively tested, and adaptive. Data was the name of the game, and in particular, what observations we see in the
						download -> lead -> show, show -> close.
					</p>

					<p>
						We set up silmultaneous approaches for info collection. An A flow and a B flow.
						A-flow collecting all information up front and getting all features up front,
						and B-flow allowing for trying out the experience a bit and giving lead info for accessing new features.

						<h3>We knew the what fairly well, but what about the why?</h3>

						<p>
							This is the interplay between quantitative data and qualitative observation.
						</p>

						<p>
							We had heaps of data, and we could easily see what minor tweaks to the onbarding flow, changes to content or activity templates, resulted and what effect down the chain.
						</p>

						<p>
							But at this point, we decided to do a moderated study to uncover what might yet be lacking or missing the mark.

							<h3>Restructure & restrategy.</h3>

							<p>
								"Do give them too much, it's a free app." - This didn't mean giving away features of the product, but from in-person moderated studies
								we found that we simply weren't describing enough of how EF works and giving a preview of what students would get once signed up.
							</p>

							<p>
								So we restructured the app to provide this content. Just writing out our teaching methodology, and connecting in-app learning with the equivilent of what would happen once at EF.
							</p>

							<p>
								We approximated our structure, content, and learning activities to their "at-EF" equivilents, and at key milestones of learning, we highlighted this link between in-app content and activities with goings on at EF centers.
