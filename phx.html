					<h4>"TLDR;"</h4>

					<p>
						Marketing and operations had come up with a new way to package and sell our core learning
						product for an initial trial in Hangzhou, China to later expand to our Russia, Spain and
						Indonesia markets.
					</p>

					<p>
						We set out to create a web experience that showcased EF’s offerings in a
						lifestyle and experiential way with a heavy emphasis on our teachers.
						An experience informing current and returning students of the features
						now available to them, while allowing potential new students to explore and
						piece together their own package.

					<h4>The ask.</h4>

					<p>
						We needed to come up with something informative and exciting. Something not simply to explain but guide
						a potential new student through 6 new marketing tracks which would serve as the basis for the core messaging of the experiences we would create.

					</p>

					<p>
						Something that could track data, react to it, and something which could be
						easily created and updated using Adobe Experience Manager, the CMS with which this site would be made and managed.

						<h4>The process.</h4>

						<p>
							Myself, visual designer <a target="_blank" href="https://adiconstantin.com/">Adi Constantin</a>, our product owner and the VP of marketing worked closely with the marketing and ops teams to define a
							solution not just focused around KPIs but a tool which they could use to react quickly to KPIs and live data coming in.

						</p>

						<p>
							Starting with affinity mapping (seeing, thinking, feeling, doing), we established our users’ goals within each marketing funnel into “experience funnels”.
							These are flows through which a site visitors would learn about what’s offered, define their product package, and sign up for a consultation call or
							schedule a demo lesson at an EF learning Center.

						</p>

						<p>
							We designed each experience funnel in terms of modular components more than simply web pages,
							so that the messaging could be changed and steps moved around as the BI team actively tested the funnels
							and messaging for performance. A modular approach allowed some messages to take the priority over others and
							the priority to be shifted when necessary, since if we flooded a user’s experience with equally important
							competing messaging: when everything’s important, nothing is.

			<h4>“Nobody Wants to be THAT cool.”</h4>

			<p>
				I conducted quick, lightweight “sanity checks” with users along the way to test our initial concepts, flows, and imagery.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once we had the first visual mockups completed, I decided to check the overall look and feel, with particular attention to the images.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still one of my favorite quotes of user feedback to-date, one among 30 participants said, "We all want to be cool people, but nobody wants to be <b><i>that</i></b> cool. It looks like a page for recruiting designers and high fashion."
			</p>

			<p>
				We decided then to refocus our imagery on things being relatable and descriptive of EF, using actual imagery from around EF, even around the world,
				by connecting with a staff photographer friend of ours who was traveling already for another business unit.
				On subsequent tests, it was clear that this helped the messaging to be far more relatable to people, yet of high quality.
