					<h3>Reducing confusion, reducing cost.</h3>

					<p>
						Aligning business goals to our intuition for an inherently better
						user experience is easier said than done, yet facilitating this communication
						is one of the primary roles of a designer.
					</p>

					<p>We knew what things about our product we felt are obvious to-dos, but we aren't the only ones who should be involved.
						While simultaneously conducting studies with students and clients, I led a series of initial workshops with our business
						and operations teams to go through the current product and highlight known issues.
					</p>

					<p>
						My goal was to drive the conversation to be about the product as a whole end-to-end experience, rather than
						a collection of pages and screens.

						<h3>OUR APPROACH AND HYPOTHESIS.</h3>

						<p>
							By focusing on our students and their learning journey, we strongly felt that
							by empowering them to learn English rather than having to learn how to use the school would bring the results the business was after. Reduced operations & support costs.
						</p>

						<p>
							Students were, in general, confused and lost at times when navagating basic features of the school and what goals were set up by their
							training managers at their own companies. "What do I need to do, by when, and how?"
						</p>

						<p>
							This priority and approach we collected from usage data, support call center logs, and recent user studies which we took to the business and informed
							our round of initial workshops to define, align and prioritize the problem before getting right into conceptual wireframes and exploring solutions.
						</p>

					<h3>DEFINE, ALIGN & PRIORITIZE.</h3>

					<p>
						We put ‘taking stakeholders along for the journey’ into practice: 3 part miniseries of workshops.
					</p>

					<p>
						1. Identify the problems from user data and our knowledge. We gathered together business leaders, a support center manager, engineering, design and product team members.
					</p>

					<p>
						2. We went away and digested all this info with the goal being to help show the business how these issues with the product were due to various issues across students' learning journies and not simply
						contained in any one piecemeal sellable component, webpage or app view.
					</p>

					<p>
						3. We discussed and ideated [sketching sessions], aligned and prioritized [debated and voted], and decided on our first set of priorities.

					<h3>Proposal.</h3>

					<p>
						Having identified affinity of issues across the views for the overall product, as similar issues and thoughts spanned the divisions of discrete UIs, we set to work to bring back the initial proposal to the business
						in the form of initial, high-level annotated wireframes.

						<h3>Kicking up the fidelity, and continuing to test.</h3>

						<p>
							We then got into wires & designs for different descrete steps along the student journey, so far putting together a complete end-to-end design for enrolment & onboarding, and getting into the first lessons with clearer steps and phased introduction
							to new features.
						</p>

						<p>
							Prototyping early & light with something like InVision studio helps to explore a feel to the look and get it in front of people early on.
						</p>

						<p>
							Using maze.design to reach our real students via banners in our school, and quickly going down to our office cafe and running flows and prototypes by folks, we keep up with frequent
							sanity checks while building up to larger moderated studies.
